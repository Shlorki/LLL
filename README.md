# The LLL and Integral LLL algorithms

The standard and integral LLL algorithms programmed in Python. Both algorithms take in a non-singular n dimensional square matrix and outputs an LLL reduced matrix, the corresponding transformation matrix, the final Gram-schmidt coefficients, and the vectors used to test the LLL condition
